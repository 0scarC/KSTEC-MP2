GRADING RUBRIC
Prompt: MERN Stack Application
Let's make an MERN Stack Application to practice our skills using React, Redux, and postgreSQL. This application can be just about anything and will assess your ability delegate the workload amongst your peers as well as get much needed practice using the GitHub workflow.

What is a MERN Stack Application?
An application that features an Express.js back-end connected to a MongoDB or postgreSQL database along with React App front-end interface. Beyond that, this application can be anything that your group wants.

Disclaimer: While it's great to look at existing MERN stack projects you can find online for inspiration, keep in mind the MVP and timeframe in which to complete your group project. Don't overload the application with too many bells and whistles.

Examples and Inspiration
Recipe Application
Utilize a server-side API to fetch recipes and then save your favorites to the database.

Online Learning Application
You can make an application that will teach and quiz your user on any subject you like. This project is for English Language Learners.

Social Meet-Up Application
Have you ever wanted to build a website that connected people based on their interests like music, movies, etc. Here is your opportunity! Build a meet-up application which allows users to find and create events based on their interests!

Requirements
General Requirements
This is a group project!
Just to clarify, your instructional staff will help you in building groups in your cohort.
This game cannot be an assignment we've already done in class.
This application must run in a web browser.
This application must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum of 20 commits.
Your empty project repository must be up on GitHub on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
This application must be deployed! You will need to use a service like Heroku, as this project will need to have a deployed back-end.
Application Requirements
Your application must be a full-stack application using your own front and back-end.
Your application should use full CRUD functionality with the database.
Your application should be a complete product.
Your application must be deployed online using deployment sites like Heroku or Netlify.
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
You should use several sensibly named components in React
The application should have a Readme.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the inspiration for the application, how to use the application, lists the technologies used to build the application, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
Bonus Ideas
Utilize an external styling library for React like React-Bootstrap or Material UI.
Explore NPM packages that will help in the logic of your application.
Try to use the StateProvider in Redux to manipulate the state of your application.
Deliverables
A working application built by the whole group
A link to your application, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
A link to your GitHub repository, so we can see the progress on your application
A README.md file with the requirements stated above
